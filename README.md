# Flatiron-Phase-1-Project

## Description

This Flatiron Phase 1 Project provides typical link budget scenarios for input in the form of Telecom Cards that show the input parameters for different link budget scenarios. These Telecom Cards will display next to an actual Link Budget Form that can receive input parameters to calculate a link budget.

## Installation

This project was installed in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Usage

This is used by Telecom Professionals who maybe do not know what parameters are typical of different types of telecom link budgets.

## Support

You can go to the authour of this website, Roscoe Michael Moore III, at his email address of rmoore@peersat.com if you have questions or need support.

## Roadmap

In future releases of this website, the formatting and aesthetics of the link budget forms and the telecom cards will be improved.
